Exercise (Instructions): Configuring your React Application
Objectives and Outcomes
In this exercise we will set up our project to use Reactstrap (a package supporting easy to use React based Bootstrap 4 components). We will then introduce our first reactstrap component into our application. At the end of this exercise you will be able to:

Configure your React project to use reactstrap.

Start using reactstrap components in your application.

Configure your React Project to use Reactstrap
To configure your project to use reactstrap, type the following at the prompt to install reactstrap, and Bootstrap 4:

312
yarn add bootstrap@4.0.0
yarn add reactstrap@5.0.0
yarn add react-popper@0.9.2
Note: You can also install the same using npm using the "npm install <package> --save" option if you are using npm instead of yarn.

Configure to use Bootstrap 4
Next, open index.js file in the src folder and add the following line into the imports:

312
. . .
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
. . .
Adding a Navigation Bar:
Open App.js in the src folder and update it as follows:

19131415161718891011123456712
. . .

import { Navbar, NavbarBrand } from 'reactstrap';
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <Navbar dark color="primary">
          <div className="container">
            <NavbarBrand href="/">Ristorante Con Fusion</NavbarBrand>
          </div>
        </Navbar>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
